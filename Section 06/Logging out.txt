Logging out
Hey there!

Logging in means that when we get a cookie from the user, we can map it to a session in our server and that session contains something meaningful. In our application, if the session contains an 'email', that tells us the user logged in.

That's because when the user sends us their email and password to log in, we put their email in the session.

The only way email could be in the session is if the user logged in.

So how could we perform a log out

Simple, just remove the email from the session. Something like this

@user_blueprint.route('logout')
def logout()
    session['email'] = None
    return redirect('.user_login')
What happens next is that when the user tries to access a protected endpoint, we'll see if 'email' has a value. Since it doesn't, we'll know the user is logged out. They'll need to log back in for session['email'] to be populated!

As with many things in web programming, moving data from one place to another (in this case, the user's email) is the way to achieve most things.

Happy coding!
