Get the course e-book!
Hello! Thank you for signing up to the course!

To make your learning easier, I've created an e-book to go along the course. This e-book covers the first few sections of the course content so that while you get started, you have this extra reference.

You can read the e-book here httpsjslvtr.gitbooks.iocomplete-python-webcontent

For those of you who are completely new to Python and programming, we've also written this other e-book. It isn't directly related to course contents, but it does teach Python fundamentals which are very good to know. I recommend giving it a quick read if diving right into the videos seems a bit daunting.
