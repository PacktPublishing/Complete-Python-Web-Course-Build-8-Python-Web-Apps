Installing Python in Ubuntu
Preface
This lecture is a text lecture because we spotted an error in the original video lecture. We're working to re-record the video lecture and bring it back, but in the meantime we thought it would be best to have the correct information in a text lecture, rather than incorrect information in a video lecture!

Installing Python in Ubuntu
To install Python in Ubuntu we need to

Install required packages via apt

Install the Python package

Install pipenv to handle our environment

Install the project's requirements

First, the required packages and the Python package

sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppadeadsnakesppa
sudo apt install build-essential python3.7-dev python3-pip python3.7
Then, install pipenv

pip3 install --user pipenv
echo PATH=$HOME.localbin$PATH  ~.bashrc
source ~.bashrc
Finally, install the project's requirements.

Make sure you are in the project folder that you cloned from git, as that has the Pipfile which contains all the requirements for our project. Then

pipenv install
Easy as that! If you encounter any problems, please let us know in the Course Q&A and we'll give you a hand.

Happy coding!
