DigitalOcean Droplets
In this section we cover deploying to our own Linux servers. I recommend using the provider DigitalOcean because of two reasons

It is cheap
It is fast and reliable
You can use the following link for registration to DigitalOcean, and it will give you $10 credit (which is renting a server for two months) httpsm.do.cocd54c088544ed. Do notice this is a referral link, but it does not make things more expensive for you; it simply gives you free starting credit.

In addition, if you choose to continue using DigitalOcean, I receive $25 from them if you ever spend $25. It's a win-win scenario for both, but it's up to you whether you want to use it or not!

If you prefer not to use the link above, just register at httpswww.digitalocean.com! It's free to register, although renting a server is not free.

I'll see you in the next video!

Kind regards,
