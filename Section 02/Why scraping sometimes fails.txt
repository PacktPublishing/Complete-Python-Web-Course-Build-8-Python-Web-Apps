Why scraping sometimes fails
Hey!

In this section we use John Lewis to get pricing information. That's because John Lewis doesn't block us from accessing their site using a program, and because John Lewis doesn't use JavaScript.

Those are two big reasons scraping can fail. For this section, please use the same website as I do in the videos to make sure your code works. After you're sure it works, you can change the site to something you're more interested in.

That way, you'll know whether the code is not working, or the site is blocking us or using JavaScript.

So... why does scraping not work with JavaScript I've written a blog post on that httpblog.tecladocode.comwhy-scraping-fail-requests-beautifulsoup-python
