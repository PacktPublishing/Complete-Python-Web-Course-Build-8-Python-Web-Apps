1. I get a long error which contains the text exception in initAndListen 29 Data directory datadb not found., terminating.
MongoDB needs a directory called datadb to place data in it. Run the following commands in the terminal

On Mac (Terminal.app) sudo mkdir -p datadb && sudo chown `whoami` datadb

On Windows (cmd.exe) md datadb

2. I get a long error which contains the text exception in initAndListen 98 Unable to createopen lock file datadbmongod.lock errno13 Permission denied Is a mongod instance already running, terminating.
This error should only happen on Mac or Linux. If it happens in Windows, please ask a question in the Q&A.

On Mac sudo chown `whoami` datadb

When shutting down MongoDB, press Control+C. Don't just close the terminal Window!
