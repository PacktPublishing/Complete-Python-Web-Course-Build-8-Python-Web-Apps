Our MongoDB e-book
Hey!

To help you in this section and in the coming sections, we've written a short MongoDB e-book.

This e-book is meant to serve as a reference, so if you encounter any problems with MongoDB, check the e-book FAQ pages first!

The e-book also has a section for how to install and set-up MongoDB on both Mac and Windows. These are here so you will have absolutely no issues getting everything set up locally!

There is also a MongoDB with Python section in the e-book which may seem a bit advanced if you read it before going through this section. Don't worry! Use it as a reference and it will prove really useful.

Access the e-book here - https://mongodb.tecladocode.com/

Happy coding!
